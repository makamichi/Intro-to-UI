          <p>Arguably Europe’s most enticing country, Italy charms visitors with irresistible food, awesome architecture, diverse scenery and unparalleled art. In fact, it's so packed with possibilities it can almost overwhelm. If you’ve not visited
            before you could well wonder what to see? Where to go? How to travel? Here’s everything you need to know to get the absolute utmost out of your first trip to Italy.</p>

        <h3>Florence and Tuscany: Art and Wine</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Two days in Florence sees you cherry-picking the incomparable art in the Uffizi gallery, delighting in the frescoes in the Duomo and pondering the anatomy of Michelangelo's David. It also allows for shopping on the ultra-chic Via de'
            Tornabuoni and an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) or two in locals' favourite Piazza della Signoria.</p>

          <p>Check into one of the idyllic rural farmhouses in Chianti and spend time exploring a land where vine trellises snake along rolling hills with Romanesque churches sheltering in their folds. Wineries lie everywhere. At extraordinary
            Antinori, for example, the high quality of the wine is matched by high-tech architectural innovation. A day trip to gorgeously Gothic Siena sees you marvelling at the Italian ability to turn buildings into art.</p>

        <div class="text">

          <p>To enjoy unique, utterly exquisite Venice, allow a few days. Glide down the Grand Canal, by gondola or vaporetto (water bus), tour the grand Palazzo Ducale, gape at the treasure-filled Basilica di San Marco and run out of camera space
            snapping the extraordinary array of Venetian architecture. There'll also be time to join the locals shopping at Rialto Market, tuck into cicheti (Venetian tapas) and get a little lost amid the 400 bridges and 150 canals.</p>

        <h3>Style and beauty in Milan and the Lakes</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>For big-city style and legendary landscapes, head to Italy’s northwest. A day in Milan opens up a grand Gothic Duomo (cathedral), Leonardo Da Vinci's Last Supper and world-class opera at La Scala. A short train ride away, belle époque
            Lake Maggiore harbours the beguiling Borromean Islands, specks of rock crowned by ornate palaces and extravagant gardens. Or spend a few days at glamorous Lake Como revelling in lake-lapped cocktail bars, sumptuous villas, vintage
            speedboat trips and the snowy-mountains-meets-azure-water scenery.</p>

        <div class="text">

          <p>In Cinque Terre National Park terraced vineyards cling to sheer hills traversed by improbably steep hiking trails, and villages flow down to tiny harbours lined with restaurants and bars. Ferries and a rattling rural train link the five
            villages. Allow two to four days to hit the walking trails, swim in the sea, soak up the atmosphere and re-charge.

        <h3>Eating and drinking</h3>
        <div class="text">

          <p>The diversity of regional cuisine alone is worth travelling to Italy for. Bistecca alla fiorentina (Florence's iconic T-bone steak); creamy Po plains risotto; olive oil and lemon-laced grilled fish on Elba; espresso and sweet treats in
            Naples' backstreets bars; fresh-from-the-wood-oven pizza al taglio (pizza by the slice) in Rome. And as for sampling Brunello, Chianti, Prosecco, Montepulciano and Soave wines in historic cellars and in restaurants just yards from the
            vines – that’s an experience that lingers for life.

          <ul>
            <li>When greeting people, shake hands or kiss both cheeks and say buongiorno (good day) or buona sera (good evening). Only use first names if invited.</li>
            <li>Restaurants have a cover charge (coperto) of €2-3. If service isn’t included, a small tip may well prompt a smile.</li>
            <li>When visiting religious sites avoid offence by dressing modestly: cover shoulders, torsos and thighs. Although shorts and sandals are fine for the beach, you'll need smart-casual clothes for towns. Walking shoes make cobbled streets
              and hill paths more comfortable, as will a sunhat, sunscreen and sunglasses.</li>
            <li>In the main tourist centres English is fairly widely spoken, but in rural areas and south of Rome learning a few key expressions and using a phrasebook/phone app with a menu guide will make your visit more fun and mealtimes more
              enjoyable.</li>
